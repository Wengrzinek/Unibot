# Project

 This project was created by three computer science students for their 'Basics of AI' programming class. 
 For this project we are going to create our own chat bot with Discord integration named space bot. Space bot supports
 Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML 1.0). Space bot is able to do a little small talk like jokes
 and can talk about space. It includes a sparql dbpedia service.
